	<h1>Panic Software Website <span>Review</span></h1>
	
	<p>This review will undoubtedly be a little biased since I've been a long time user of Panic products, but I'll try and be as neutral as possible.The first thing you notice is the huge typeface. I'm a pretty big fan of this, both for 	aesthetic reasons and its readability. The message is simple and clear.</p>
	
	<p>The icons and their hover states offer a nice contrast against the rather flat design of the website. It's a nice interaction. Again, big type that offers a nice clear message of what the application does.</p>
	
	<p>I like the letterpress style of the footer, and it subsequently offers quick tools for things you might visit a support website for. This follows the theme of the rest of the site in that it offers exactly what is needed, no more 	no less. Overall I think the design and interactions are perfect for the type of user that would visit this site.</p>
