A List Apart is a web publication I follow to keep up with user experience and other web related news. They were recently redesigned (with some controversy) from a very 2000's "bloggy" format, to one that really puts content out there with heavy weight. There's very few high content web experiences that I think translate well to mobile, but this is definitely one of them. When you look at the desktop vs. mobile version you really don't feel like you're experiencing two different products.

Both versions include large, easy to read text, and the featured story is always the first thing you see. An interesting decision was to cut off some of the header logo and fix its position. This is sort of an overt exclamation that really drives home how important they feel the content is (higher than their own logo). Again, this is one of very few sites I can just "surf" while on my phone because of its simplicity and readability. Although it was met with some dislike from the community, I think the need for device agnostic sites will start driving more and more of this type of design.
