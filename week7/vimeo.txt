Wow. Maybe I haven't been to Vimeo in a while, but I don't remember all the illustrations and vertical scrolling. I'm a pretty big fan of custom illustrations. I think it gives the ability to push a message you're trying to convey even further, and gives the site a more personal feel. I'm not exactly sure if I'm digging this one. It's a bit confusing to me what they're trying to illustrate and how it expands on their brand.

I am a big fan of accessible content and not breaking it up when it doesn't call for it. For this reason I enjoy the fact that they've put pretty much all content high up in the hierarchy on the landing page. The drop down navigational items in the hover states expand on this by revealing architecture without forcing a page reload. Overall I thought the site had some pretty intuitive interactions that got a little muddied by the illustrations. Maybe a cleaner, more streamlined style could've tied this all together.
