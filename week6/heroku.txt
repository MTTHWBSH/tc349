To start with I have a couple critiques. The first of these is that I'm wondering why the navigation isn't in a fixed position. The top level navigation items seem like ones that could be utilized at any browsing point, and the fact that it's already a top level element lends itself to being fixed. The interface is also *very* dark. I wouldn't mind seeing some more light, contrasting colors to balance it out.

I really enjoy the icons used. They have a custom feel to them and you can tell some thought was put into their creation, instead of just ripping off free vectors somewhere. Another thing I'm noticing when navigating through the site is the sudden interface changes. For instance, when clicking through to "add-ons" you're introduced to an entirely new interface and it's a bit jarring.

For my "data-viz" project I decided to go with a psuedo-double-column layout, reserving the site bar for navigation. I chose this because I wanted to incorporate a vertical scrolling interaction that presents each piece as part of a large experiment. This layout offers a more linear-progression feel as opposed to featuring every piece as a separate part of the site. I think this will better show my progress and the way I build off of each previous visualization.
