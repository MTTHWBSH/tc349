Before I get into my review of MSU's mobile site, I need to start by saying this: I really don't like the idea of "mobile sites". I'm a huge supporter of the responsive movement, not simply because it makes the development process easier, but because it's a device agnostic approach that isn't serving up different content for different devices. It's also a bit more future proof (if that is possible in tech) in the sense that in a couple years, what we consider "mobile" now almost certainly won't be how we understand mobile then. Then what do we do? Develop an entire new site for that medium? It's in inaccessible approach that I really don't like.

As far as the actual site goes, not a fan of that either. Navigation is a nightmare, there's not really a global navigation set that I see and interior pages could really make use of breadcrumbs to enable users to swiftly  navigate between pages. The current navigation makes use of iconography, which is a popular trend in designing for mobile, but I'm not really sure they aid in the user experience in any way.

The site could be improved by decreasing the amount of interior pages it takes to navigate in a user goal. Especially on mobile, the more clicks you have to make to satisfy a goal, the more inefficient it is. Getting more content that users are looking for on one view could help overcome this.
