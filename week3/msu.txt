Compared to the last iteration, this redesign does a great job of granulating information and organizing it appropriately. Before this, the landing view displayed way too much information for a user to digest, and probably deterred many users from moving forward. The standard convention of using a dropdown nav to create an information hierarchy is a good one, although it doesn't adapt well to smaller viewports in this iteration.

The lighter background works well to make content feel less congested, but they sort of combat this by tightly grouping all content together and not really establishing a grid. This makes the content seem cluttered and congested. I'd like to see some analytics on user paths in the navigation, their arrangement makes sense but I'm wondering how this could degrade to a smaller viewport, simply displaying the main navigation items in a block and letting users navigate through the sub-pages could be a good solution.
