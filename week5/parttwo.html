		<p>For this portion of the assignment I decided to ask the same participants to work with me in structuring the information architecture for my data-visualization 
		sandbox. This was an interesting task, since I wasn't totally sure what I wanted this "sandbox" to be, but that is why it was necessary. This site is obviously going to 
		be pretty light on content outside of the pieces I create, but we hammered out a nice structure that every piece should include.</p>
		<p>I wanted this space to act as more than just a repository, and be able to explain my work and the process for each piece. To achieve this we added content types like 
		an excerpt/reflection on each piece, all the resources used, and the data set used. Since the content was so light, we didn't run into any major differences in content 
		organization, and I believe we reached a pretty good point that will allow the site to achieve its goal of being an open-documented data visualization sandbox</p>
