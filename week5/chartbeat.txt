I'm a big fan of vertical scrolling when you are trying to tell a linear story with content. This also lends itself to grouping content that relates to each other and provides more separation between different page views. If you don't need to force a page reload for new data, I don't see a point in doing it.

They certainly use a lot of current web trends in this site. The "triangle cutout" section breaks, some parallax elements, and interactive illustrations. Each of these things serves more than an aesthetic purpose and they are done tastefully, so in that sense I enjoy them. Being the data nerd that I am I enjoy all the counters, any numbers that you can throw at me I'll baldy analyze, so those bits were a nice addition to look at.
