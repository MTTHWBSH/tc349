		<p>For my card-sorting activity, I started out a little differently by doing a Gchat with my other participants to hammer out what we thought were the most important 
		content types. I did this knowing that the participants were familiar and comfortable with this type of activity, and was interested in seeing how the structure/
		organization differed with the same content types, and if any were omitted or simplified in the final decision. The deliverables came in the form of chat responses, so I 
		did my best to organize each into their own graph/tree.
		</p>
		<p>The biggest difference I noticed was the convention in naming information containers. I broke up our discussed content types into actionable things like "user-
		interaction" and "commerce", whereas others took a more "site-tree" approach and create linear paths down each piece of content. The third subject totally stripped the 
		site of any extraneous information and created user paths for each (of what he considered) were the most important tasks in the site. I thought these results were pretty 
		interesting, especially because all participants come from some sort of background of working with the web.
