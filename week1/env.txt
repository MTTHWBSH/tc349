I've included 3 screen shots for my dev environment then I spread across 3 desktops (or another monitor when I'm at home). For my editor I've been a long time user of Coda and recently upgraded to Coda 2. Coda is a well organized, feature rich application that still has the feel of a barebones editor. Things like shell tabs, a sleek UI, code folding,and a built in MySQL editor. This is what I use to make edits to any working files.

Some background applications I use are Transmit and CodeKit. Transmit allows me to mount my server as disk. This is a great feature that lets me easily browse my server files through the finder. Another very important reason of using this is so that CodeKit can look for project folders locally and compile/minify/optimize any files it's looking for in those project folders.

My browser development is as follows. Build for webkit in Chrome using Chrome dev tools. Tweak in Safari and Firefox, bandage in IE if the project calls for it. For most projects, I spend the majority of my time debugging with Chrome's dev tools
