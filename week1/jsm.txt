First and foremost, big fan of the whitespace. I recently implemented a responsive redesign for The State News and one of the biggest aesthetic changes was dropping dark backgrounds and letting the content breathe. This is important for high content sites to let the content start to structure itself and provides clearer content separation. I like the one-column grid but the content within it seems  a little unbalanced. Maybe considering a new way to display feature photos would help? Another feature I would like to see is a sticky nav bar, its already placed at the top so it would be simple to just absolutely position it so users don't have to scroll up to navigate.

The  "ARTICLES" section is quite a bit to look at, and the taxonomy is pretty daunting. Maybe a better IA for this, or at least pagination. I like the footer, it's a fun place to get stylistic, but maybe including a site map or something rather than a sort of content dump would've been nice. Also not sure about the search form in the footer. The convention seems to be top left or right, that's certainly where I usually look for it.
